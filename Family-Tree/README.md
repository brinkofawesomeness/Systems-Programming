# Family Tree
A program that reads in a description of people and their relationships and then fills in missing information before printing all of it out. This is also the first program I've ever writting in pure C, and it has a red-black tree, depth-first search, and a breadth-first search.

The "tests" directory has sample input to use for the program that can be given on standard in.
