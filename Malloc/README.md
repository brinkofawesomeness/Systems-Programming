# Malloc
This program mimics the malloc C function, where it goes out to the operating systems and gets the specific number of bytes the user asks for. It uses a free list so that memory isn't being wasted when it's returned back to the operating system. The makefile compiles it with other programs from this course to see if it holds up...it does.
